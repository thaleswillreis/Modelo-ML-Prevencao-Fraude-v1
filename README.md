# Machine Learning Model to prevent fraud in bank loans

Project aimed at creating, training and evaluating a machine learning model to classify customers most likely to commit fraud in bank loan contracts.

## Project phases

1. Exploratory data analysis

    * Verification of the general characteristics of the data;
    * Checking for missing data;
    * Checking for inconsistent data;
    * Attribute engineering;
2. Data visualization

    * Creation of tables and graphs;
3. Data transformation

    * Creation of new data columns;
    * Treatment of null or incorrect data;
    * Deletion of irrelevant data;
    * One Hot Encoding (adaptation of types according to the algorithm);
    * Balancing the target variable and predictors;
    * Separation of training and testing data;
    * Normalization and/or Standardization of data;
4. Model Creation, Training and Evaluation

    * Machine Learning model training;
    * Creation of the classifier;
    * Evaluation of the created model;

## Technologies Used

This project was executed using the Python language in the Jupyter Notebook format. The libraries Pandas (Loading, Cleaning and Data Analysis), Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization and graph generation), Sklearn (Creation, training and evaluation of the Machine Learning model), Git (Code versioning) and the The chosen IDE was Visual Studio Code, running on Debian Linux.

## How to run the project

To run the project the following methods can be used:

#### *Method 1:* Download the project

**Step 1:**

On the project's main page [https://github.com/thaleswillreis/Modelo-ML-Prevencao-Fraude-v1](https://github.com/thaleswillreis/Modelo-ML-Prevencao-Fraude-v1), search for the green button containing the name "<> Code".

**Step 2:**

Click "Download ZIP"

**Step 3:**

Unzip the folder you finished downloading.

**Step 4:**

Open projects containing the ".ipynb" extension.

#### *Method 2:* Clone the repository

Note: Before proceeding with this process, make sure that GitHub is properly configured on your computer.

**Step 1:**

Create a folder that you have write permissions to.

**Step 2:**

Open a terminal from the newly created folder or navigate to it through the terminal.

**Step 3:**

On the project's main page [https://github.com/thaleswillreis/Modelo-ML-Prevencao-Fraude-v1](https://github.com/thaleswillreis/Modelo-ML-Prevencao-Fraude-v1), search for the green button containing the name "<> Code". (See image in previous method)

**Step 4:**

Copy the repository URL.

**Step 5:**

In the terminal type:

```
git Clone git@github.com:thaleswillreis/Modelo-ML-Prevencao-Fraude-v1.git
```

Wait for the repository cloning to finish.

**Step 6:**

Open projects containing the ".ipynb" extension.

## Problems faced

The code may face problems when running using different versions of languages and libraries. Make sure that the versions listed in the "Required Dependencies and Versions" item are correctly installed.

If there is already a development environment with different versions in use on the machine used, a good alternative would be to create a virtual development environment. If in doubt, follow the documentation link.
